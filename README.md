## Skateboard

The objective for this assignment was to make a skateboard using new keybind and tools that not everybody was familiar with. These new skills can be applied to future projects to increase productivity.

## 2.1 The Deck

Obviously Shift S will start a new sketch but something I didn't know is that Shift F can be used to quick select the fillet tool.

## 2.2 The Trucks

The offset tool proved useful in this section due to the placement of the screws on the deck. It can be used in a sketch to make another sketch slightly inwards or outwards from the original. The use tool is also good but you have to make sure you are on the right plane for it to work correctly.

## 2.3 Wheels and Bearings

To shape the wheel we used the revolve tool. This can be used with the R key is utilized to turn a flat plane into a extruded circle.

## 2.4 Putting it All Together

The main takeaway from this part of the assignment is the replicate tool. With this you can take a piece in an assembly and replicate it over all other similar faces in the assembly.
